# Fraud Detection Project 🔍💳

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and evaluate performance effectively.

## 📚 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  - Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall, ROC-AUC)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Open the notebook file (`fraud_detection.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE like VS Code.

4. Run the cells step-by-step.

## 📈 Key Results
- Built models with high precision and recall to identify fraud cases.
- Applied oversampling/undersampling techniques to handle class imbalance.
- ROC-AUC score of **XX%** achieved with [your best model].

## 📋 Dataset
